I am currently completing my Ph.D. in Biostatistics at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/), where I have been fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Ching-Ti Liu](https://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/ching-ti-liu/) and [Dr. Gina Peloso](https://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/gina-m-peloso/). I am an active member of the [NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program](https://www.nhlbiwgs.org/) and the [Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC)](http://lipidgenetics.org/), collaborating closely with [Dr. Pradeep Natarajan](https://cvri.mgh.harvard.edu/pradeep-natarajan-md-mm-sc/), Dr. Jacqueline Dron, [Dr. Xihong Lin](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/xihong-lin/), and [Dr. Xihao Li](https://xlinlab.github.io/xihaoli/).

In the summer of 2024, I joined [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/) as a Human Genetics Intern, working under the mentorship of [Dr. Christian Benner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-benner-28769711/) and [Dr. Anubha Mahajan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anubha-mahajan/).

Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned an M.S. in Biostatistics from [Yale University](https://ysph.yale.edu/), where I was advised by [Dr. Denise Esserman](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/denise_esserman/) and [Dr. Hongyu Zhao](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/hongyu_zhao/).
